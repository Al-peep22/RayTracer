# Ray Tracer

## Introduction
This project is a **C++ ray tracer** built to simulate realistic lighting and material interactions. It supports multiple rendering techniques including anti-aliasing, reflections, and refractions, producing high-quality offline renders.

## Features
- Material system with diffuse, specular, reflective, and refractive properties
- Anti-aliasing for smoother edges
- Multiple-bounce reflections and refractions
- Support for spheres, planes, and mesh objects
- Configurable camera and scene setup

## Installation
### Requirements
- C++17 or later
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Al-peep22/RayTracer.git
